                <p>The UC Davis Design Careers Club was founded in 2016 by Tiffany Trieu after two years of leading successful student-run career fairs for the UCD Design Department. We're a multi-disciplinary club that seeks to unite people from varied
                    background in the pursuit of design. Hosting both large and small events, we work to connect current students with alumni, design professionals, and resources on and off campus.</p>
