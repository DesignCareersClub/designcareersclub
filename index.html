                <h2>About DCC</h2>
                <p>In in 2016, after two years of organizing successful student-run career fairs for our Design Department, the UC Davis Design Careers Club was founded by our first director, Tiffany Trieu. We are a multi-disciplinary club that seeks to
                    unite students from varied backgrounds in the pursuit of design learning and excellence. Hosting both large and small events on and off campus, we work to connect current students with alumni, design professionals, and resources and
                    prepare them to step out confidently into the working world.</p>

                <p>The UC Davis Design Career Club aims to empower students to take bold risks not only in their designs, but in their career aspirations. We provide three main events each year: Internship Night each Fall, Alumni Networking Day each Winter,
                    and the Design Career Fair each Spring.</p>
